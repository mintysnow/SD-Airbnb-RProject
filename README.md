# SD-Airbnb-RProject

## Project Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to analyze current listings in San Diego to see where someone should consider being host and find what makes listings successful. 

## Findings
- Guests stay in Western and Central districts the most.
  - Since these two districts are near the ocean, it's likely that guests are staying here due to its proximity to the beaches. 
  - It's also near big attractions like SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, and Downtown San Diego which is known to have a great nightlife. 
  - Another reason may be that there is an airport that borders Western and Central so people may be opting to stay in Airbnbs in that area.
- Listings should offer at least 34 amenities.
  - More amenities could make a home stand out over compeititors.
- Make sure to have high availability in December, especially Friday-Sunday as guests make more reservations during these times.
