+ Breakdown of neighborhoods to districts
+ How many listings are in San Diego and where are they located?
+ Which hosts have multiple listings and where are they?
+ Average number of occupants allowed in a rental
+ As a perspective host, where should you consider opening an airbnb? 
+ As a perspective guest, where are most guest staying in San Diego and how much are they paying?
+ What impact does listing proximity to the beach have on Airbnb pricing?

## 1. Data Preprocessing

### 1.1 Load libraries
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 1.2 Load dataset
```{r load_data, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
raw.df <- readr::read_csv("./listings.csv")
raw.df
sd.df = raw.df
```

### 1.3 Clean your data
```{r}
sort(unique(sd.df$neighbourhood))
```
